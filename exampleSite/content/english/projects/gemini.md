The inspiration for 'Gemini' began with a desire for a custom case for the Novatouch TKL.

There were a few features that we wanted to tackle in our design:

* USB-C compatibility
* Inclined Typing Angle
* Gasket-Mounted

One important idea came to mind and thus the 'Gemini' was born. Why not include compatibility for a custom plate and PCB to allow for MX switches as well? Not everyone is going to have a Novatouch donor just laying around and they aren't exactly easy to find these days.

This is accomplished by offering two different top halves depending on your needs.
